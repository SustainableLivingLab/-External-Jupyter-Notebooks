One simple way  of doing it is to write a program to detect if there are people inside a classroom and depending on whether they are present, the code could send a signal to the airconditioner to turn it on. Since the process of turning on the airconditioner is a hardware problem, we will be tackling only the problem of detecting people in a classroom.
