    "Have you ever considered the job of a security officer. In some schools, office buildings and even appartements, there is often one individual is tasked with observing feeds from multiple security cameras. These security guards are capable of making mistakes. Now let us consider the situation of a theft or burglary. It is important for the security officials to be able to easily notified when there is a person on a video feed. That is what we will be solving today. We will be creating a system that is able to detect if there is a person detected on a video feed and alerting the user about it. "
